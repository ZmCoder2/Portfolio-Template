# Portfolio Template

## Description
This is web page of a Web Developers Portfolio. The Portfolio displays the Web Developers name, Lernantino at the top left of the page with styling added such as color, size, and font.
Next you will see over to the top right side of the where it displays "Lernantino" are some links that contain About Me, My Work, Contact Me, and Resume. Those links help the user navigate through the page by just clicking the link and takes the user to where they clicked instead of scrolling through. The links have style attributes added to give them color, size, position, and underlines.
The next section of the page displays a background image that has a design to give the Portfolio style under the navigation links and the name. Within the background image the user is able to see a colored box where the Web Developer can add a cool subtitle to add some fun to the portfolio.
Below the background image are the nav link content sections where it has the h1's (About Me, My Work, Contact Me) displayed on the left side of the page and then has lines to separate the content from the headings. So the user is able to see which section goes with what heading.
In the "My Work" section a user is able to see pictures that displays the Web Developers work with pictures that are labeled with what work is what. If the user wants to see more about the work they are able to hover over the picture that will shade over the picture indicating that the user is able to click on the work they want to view. Each image has borders around them to match the styling of the page.
Lastly, the "Contact Me" section below "My Work" displays the Web Developers phone number, email, GitHub, Twitter, and Spotify. They are links so the user is able to access the Web Developers phone number, email, GitHub, Twitter, and Spotify.
